### Historical CO2 budget

All values in billion tonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr), for the globe. For values in billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, multiply the numbers below by 3.664.

1 billion tonnes C = 1 petagram of carbon (10^15 gC) = 1 gigatonne C = 3.664 billion tonnes of CO2

#### Please note:

The methods used to estimate the historical fluxes presented below differ from the carbon budget presented for 1959-2012. The atmospheric growth and ocean sink do not account for year-to-year variability.
