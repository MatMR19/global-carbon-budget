### Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type

All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr).

For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664

1MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2

Emissions from cement production were estimated by CDIAC based on cement production data from the US Geological Survey.

The uncertainty around the estimate is about ±5 % for a ±1 sigma confidence level.
