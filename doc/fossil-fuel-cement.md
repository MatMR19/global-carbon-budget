### Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type

All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr).
For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664

1 MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2

#### Methods:

1959-2014 estimates for fossil fuel combustion and cement are from the Carbon Dioxide
Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, adjusted with
revised China statistics from 1990.  http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/meth_reg.html

2015 and 2016 estimates are preliminary and are based on energy statistics
published by BP (https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2016/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2016-full-report.pdf)
and cement production data from the US Geological
Survey (http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cement/)
and flaring is assumed to be constant since 2014 value.

The uncertainty for the global estimates is about ±5 % for a ± 1 sigma confidence level.
