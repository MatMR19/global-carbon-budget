### Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type

All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr).

For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664

1MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2

#### Methods:

1959-2013 estimates for fossil fuel combustion and cement are from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, adjusted with revised China statistics from 1990.  http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/meth_reg.html

2014 and 2015 estimates are preliminary and are based on energy statistics published by BP . <https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review-2016/bp-statistical-review-of-world-energy-2016-full-report.pdf>

2014 and 2015 emissions from cement production are from the US Geological Survey.

The source for 2014 and 2015 flaring is listed as BP in the GCP paper.

The uncertainty around the estimate is about ±5 % for a ± 1 sigma confidence level.
