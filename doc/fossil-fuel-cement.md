### Fossil fuel and cement production emissions by fuel type

All values in million tonnes of carbon per year (MtC/yr), except the per capita emissions which are in tonnes of carbon per person per year (tC/person/yr).
For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664

1 MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2

#### Methods

1959-2014 estimates for fossil fuel combustion and cement are from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, adjusted with revised China statistics from 1990. http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/emis/meth_reg.html

2017-2018 estimates are preliminary and are based on energy statistics published by BP (data in red in Columns B, C, D, E and H). https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html

Cement emissions are updated from Andrews (2018) https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/
and flaring is assumed to be constant since 2014 value (data in green in Column G).

The uncertainty for the global estimates is about ±5 % for a ± 1 sigma confidence level.
