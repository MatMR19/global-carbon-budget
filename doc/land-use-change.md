### Land-use change emissions

All values in billion tonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr), for the globe. For values in billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, multiply the numbers below by 3.664.

1 billion tonnes C = 1 petagram of carbon (10^15 gC) = 1 gigatonne C = 3.664 billion tonnes of CO2

The data below represents the net flux of land-use change, based on the net balance between deforestation and forest regrowth along with other land-use changes

1997 onwards include interannual variability as captured by satellite-based fire emissions.
