### Global Carbon Budget

All values in billion tonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr), for the globe. For values in billion tonnes of carbon dioxide per year (GtCO2/yr) , multiply the numbers below by 3.664.

Note: 1 billion tonnes C = 1 petagram of carbon (10^15 gC) = 1 gigatonne C = 3.664 billion tonnes of CO2

All uncertainties represent ± 1 sigma error (68 % chance of being in the range provided)

#### Emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes (uncertainty of ±5% for a ± 1 sigma confidence level)

The atmospheric CO2 growth rate (variable uncertainty around 0.2 GtC/yr from 1980) is estimated directly from atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements, and provided by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL).  http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/global.html

	1959-1980 are based on Mauna Loa and South Pole stations as observed by the CO2 Program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. http://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/
	1980 onwards are global averages estimated from multiple stations run by NOAA/ESRL.

#### The ocean sink (uncertainty of ±0.5 GtC/yr)

is estimated from the average of several global ocean biogeochemistry models that reproduce the observed mean ocean sink of the 1990s.

#### The land sink (uncertainty of ±0.9 GtC/yr on average)

was estimated from the average of several dynamic global vegetation models that reproduce the observed mean total land sink of the 1990s.

#### The budget imbalance

is the sum of emissions (fossil fuel and industry + land-use change) minus (atmospheric growth + ocean sink + land sink); it is a measure of our imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.
